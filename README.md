# Myxozoa_supplementary
Supplementary Python code for Myxozoa ONT data processing

Oxford-Nanopore MinION sequencing has been used to produce complete and near-complete assemblies of five myxozoan genomes free from host DNA contamination. It was also used to perform DNA methylation analysis indicated the presence of DNA methylation in the GC-rich regions within gene bodies. Here are main helper scripts that have been written and used for this tasks. This project contains main Python scripts used to analyze ONT fast5 datasets and produce results together with Jupyter notebook files used to generate all the figures in the manuscript. The methods and logic behind this work is described in the manuscript. These scripts are only working excerpts not meant to be used outside of the scope of work described in the manuscript. If one wishes to reproduce the work, please change input filenames manually, since these scripts contain hardcoded file names.
