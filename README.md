# Myxozoa_supplementary
Supplementary Python code for Myxozoa ONT data processing

Oxford-Nanopore MinION sequencing has been used to produce complete and near-complete assemblies of five myxozoan genomes free from host DNA contamination. It was also used to perform DNA methylation analysis indicated the presence of DNA methylation in the GC-rich regions within gene bodies. Here are main helper scripts that have been written and used for this tasks.
